# Observability (L11)

> Built into the harness, not bolted on. Two layers — both required. Feeds the L1
> Diagnostic Loop: you can only attribute a failure to a layer if you can see what happened.

## Runtime observability — "what did the system do?"
- Structured JSON logs via the Fastify logger (`src/server.ts` enables `logger: true`).
- Per request: `reqId`, method, url, status, `responseTime`; plus lifecycle (`example-app ready`).
- App/store code logs through `req.log` / `app.log`, never `console.*` — enforced by
  `scripts/check-architecture.sh` Rule 2. (That rule was this lecture's foreshadowing.)
- Tests keep the logger off (`buildApp()` default) to stay quiet.

## Process observability — "why was this change accepted?"
- **Sprint contract** (`harness/scope/sprint-contract.md`): scope + per-item validation +
  explicit exclusions, agreed *before* coding.
- **Evaluator rubric** (`evaluator-rubric.md`): turns the independent verifier's judgment
  into reproducible, dimensioned scoring.
- **Verification log** (`verification-log.md`): the persisted evaluator evidence — which
  verifier accepted which feature, with what observed outputs. This is our decision-layer trace.

## Real OpenTelemetry (L11 deepened)
Both layers now emit **genuine OTel spans** (real trace_id/span_id/parent linkage),
exported to the console via a `SimpleSpanProcessor` + `ConsoleSpanExporter` — no external
collector required. Setup: `example-app/src/otel.ts`. Tracing is **no-op unless a provider
is registered** (`startOtel()` in `server.ts`), so tests stay silent.

- **Runtime layer:** `src/app.ts` `onRequest`/`onResponse` hooks make one span per HTTP
  request — name `METHOD /route` (templated, e.g. `GET /tasks/:id`), attributes
  `http.method`/`http.route`/`http.status_code`. Visible when you `make dev` and hit it.
- **Decision layer:** `make trace` runs `scripts/emit-feature-trace.ts`, which reads
  `feature_list.json` and emits one **session** span → a span per **feature** → a
  **verification** sub-span per passing feature (carrying the evidence/command). This is
  L11's "trace per session, span per task, sub-span per verification step" — literally,
  and all under one trace_id.

**OTLP/Jaeger (done):** set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318` and the same
spans flow to a real Jaeger collector — `make jaeger-up`, then `make trace` / `make dev`,
view at <http://localhost:16686>. Verified via Jaeger's query API. See
`docs/deep-dives/otlp-jaeger.md`.

## Why it belongs inside
Without it: correctness vs appearance is indistinguishable, evaluation goes mystical,
retries become blind guessing, and handoffs lose 30-50% of a session to re-diagnosis.
Agents can't fix this alone — they don't know what they don't know to log.
